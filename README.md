##### Hey whats up, I'm
# Morgan
##### and I'm a web developer 🕸️

Most likely you're on here to add me to a ***project*** or you've come snooping as part of the `hiring process`  
Well you're in good hands  
I've got 7 years working in business IT support 💻, a bachelor's degree in web design and production 📜, and 1 year making websites and designs 🌐

Right now I specialise in front-end and UI/UX design ✏️

I've done a fair bit in:  
✅ HTML  
✅ CSS  
✅ JavaScript  
✅ WordPress (inc. PHP, plug-ins, and custom bits)  
✅ Figma  
✅ React (check out my [reality mobile web app](https://houseview.wilde.mx/)🏡, my [helpdesk web app](http://helpdesk.wilde.mx/)🧑‍🚀, my [What's my number for 911?!](https://911.wilde.mx/)📞, or my [Github finder web app](https://githubfinder.wilde.mx/)🔍 and a big project coming.

On the side I'm an extrovert with a love for plants 🪴, animals 🐶, food 🍴, and games 🎮
